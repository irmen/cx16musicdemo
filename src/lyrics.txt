0009.670 I hear it
0012.500 Echoing of every
         place that we've
         called our home
0019.580 And I don't talk
0022.300 Of any time
         I ever believed in
         the unknown
0029.900 I need it
0032.400 So I hold on
         to every mistake
         that I made alone
0039.850 And I don't lie
0042.500 When I say that we
         will never return
         to closing doors

0050.200 Sleep tight
         in a new light
0052.500 Through another
         warning call
0060.300 Look down
         on the cold ground
0062.600 No one try
         to break the fall

0070.220 I feel it
0073.000 Moving in
         an another direction
         we call our own
0080.300 And I won't chase
0083.150 Anyone who
         ever believed in
         what they stole
0090.320 I need it
0092.900 So I hold on
         to every piece
         of mine that I chose
0100.420 And I don't lie
0103.100 When I say
         that we will never
         return to
         closing doors

0110.900 Sleep tight
         in a new light
0113.200 Through another
         warning call
0121.000 Look down
         on the cold ground
0123.400 No one try
         to break the fall

0131.100 Say you'll
         remember
0133.500 To keep it
         all inside
0135.900 You can run for
         the skyline
0138.400 Your eyes
         open wide

0141.400 Say you'll
         remember
0143.300 To keep it
         all inside
0146.200 You can run for
         the skyline
0148.600 Your eyes
         open wide

0160.500 Don't look away
0164.700 Cause when we see it
         we are closer
0170.700 Don't look away
0174.700 Cause when we see it
         we are near

0202.000 Say you'll

Original lyrics:

I hear it
Echoing of every place that we've called our home
And I don't talk
Of any time I ever believed in the unknown
I need it
So I hold on to every mistake that I made alone
And I don't lie
When I say that we will never return to closing doors

Sleep tight in a new light
Through another warning call
Look down on the cold ground
No one try to break the fall

I feel it
Moving in an another direction we call our own
And I won't chase
Anyone who ever believed in what they stole
I need it
So I hold on to every piece of mine that I chose
And I don't lie
When I say that we will never return to closing doors

Sleep tight in a new light
Through another warning call
Look down on the cold ground
No one try to break the fall

Say you'll remember
To keep it all inside
You can run for the skyline
Your eyes open wide

Say you'll remember
To keep it all inside
You can run for the skyline
Your eyes open wide

(It's a memory, it's a memory)
Don't look away
Cause when we see it we are closer
Don't look away
Cause when we see it we are near

Say you'll remember
To keep it all inside
You can run for the skyline
Your eyes open wide

Say you'll remember
To keep it all inside
You can run for the skyline
Your eyes open wide

(It's a memory, it's a memory, it's a memory, it's a memory)
(It's a memory, it's a memory, it's a memory, it's a memory)
(It's a memory, it's a memory, it's a memory, it's a memory)
(It's a memory, it's a memory, it's a memory, it's a memory)
