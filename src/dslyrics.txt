0008.400 Let's
         make a toast
         to the damned
0014.224 Waiting for
         tomorrow
0016.341 When
         we're played out
         by the band
0022.000 Drowning out
         our sorrows
0024.271 What
         will become
         of us now
0029.368 at the end of time?
0033.297 We'll be fine,
         you and I

0039.890 Let's
         draw a line
         in the sand
0045.342 Keep it straight
         and narrow
0047.890 We
         had it all
         in our hands
0053.194 We begged and
         then we borrowed
0055.706 What
         will become
         of us all
0060.854 at the end of love?
0064.782 When we've stopped
         looking up?

0070.952 You can take
         my heart
0077.183 And hold it together
         as we fall apart
0085.131 Maybe together
         we can make a mark
0089.099 in the stars
         we embark
0092.801 And keep us together
         as the lights go dark

0102.894 Let's
         tell the truth,
         just for once
0108.544 asking for
         an answer
0110.706 Now
         that it's all
         said and done
0116.400 nothing
         really matters
0118.693 What
         will become
         of us all
0123.818 if we dare to dream?
0127.775 At the end
         of the scene?

0133.860 You can take
         my heart
0140.283 hold it together
         as we fall apart
0148.095 Maybe together
         we can make a mark
0152.000 in the stars
         we embark
0156.030 Keep us together
         as the lights go dark

0197.191 Let's
         open up
         to the sky
0202.988 askin' it
         for closure
0205.280 'Least
         we can say
         that we tried
0210.360 but it's never
         really over
0213.018 What
         will become
         of us all
0218.183 at the end of
         the line?
0222.168 Will we live?
         Will we die?

0228.219 You can take
         my heart
0234.372 And hold it together
         as we fall apart
0242.517 Maybe together
         we can make a mark
0246.541 in the stars
         we embark
0250.187 And keep us together
         as the lights go dark

0259.625 And you can take
         my heart
0265.941 And hold it together
         as we fall apart
0273.945 Maybe together
         we can make a mark

Original lyrics:  https://youtu.be/tae8F4gkfiw

[Verse 1]
Let's make a toast to the damned
waitin' for tomorrow
When we're played out by the band
drowning out our sorrows
What will become of us now
at the end of time?
We'll be fine, you and I
Let's draw a line in the sand,
keep it straight and narrow
We had it all in our hands,
we begged and then we borrowed
What will become of us all
at the end of love
When we've stopped looking up?

[Chorus]
You can take my heart
And hold it together as we fall apart
Maybe together we can make a mark in the stars we embark
And keep us together as the lights go dark

[Verse 2]
Let's tell the truth, just for once, asking for an answer
Now that it's all said and done, nothing really matters
What will become of us all if we dare to dream
At the end of the scene?

[Chorus]
You can take my heart
Hold it together as we fall apart
Maybe together we can make a mark in the stars we embark
And keep us together as the lights go dark

[Verse 3]
Let's open up to the sky, askin' it for closure
'Least we can say that we tried, but it's never really over
What will become of us all at the end of the line?
Will we live? Will we die?

[Chorus]
You can take my heart
And hold it together as we fall apart
Maybe together we can make a mark in the stars we embark
And keep us together as the lights go dark
And you can take my heart
And hold it together as we fall apart
Maybe together we can make a mark in the stars we embark
And keep us together as the lights go dark
